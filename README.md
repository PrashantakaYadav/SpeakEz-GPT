In this app, i use Speech Recognition and it's an npm package called [react-speech-recognition](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-speech-recognition) that can activate the microphone and turn the user's speech into text that it can process to ChatGPT.

It supported multiple languages like:

- English
- Arabic
- Japanese

- Turkish

also, It is recommended to open this app web with Google Chrome 🌐 since other browsers do not support speech recognition.
